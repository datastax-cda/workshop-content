# Workshop Content - WIP

* Each folder represents a workshop of group of modules
* Workshops can be build/generate from multiple workshop folders
* External content can be used like: google docs and YouTube videos
* We have a public folder with read-only access where we manage google slides for workshop contents
* An alternative is use generate PDFs and include in the workshop content folder

## TODO
* Create a number of reusable workshop *config.json*
* Create standard invite emails
* Define the standard readme for each workshop folder. 

## Standards

* create an *images* directory under your workshop folder
